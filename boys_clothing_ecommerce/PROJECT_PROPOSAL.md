The Second-Hand Boys Clothing E-Commerce Marketplace addresses the growing need for sustainable and affordable clothing solutions for boys while providing a platform for sellers to monetize unused or outgrown items. This web-based marketplace connects buyers seeking quality second-hand clothing with sellers looking to declutter and earn income.

The platform solves real-world problems including: (1) **Economic accessibility** - enabling families to purchase quality clothing at reduced prices, (2) **Environmental sustainability** - promoting clothing reuse and reducing textile waste, (3) **Seller empowerment** - allowing individuals to generate income from unused items, and (4) **Trust and safety** - implementing verification systems to ensure product quality and seller authenticity.

Key features include a three-tier user system (Buyers, Sellers, Admins), comprehensive product management with categories (polo shirts, casual/formal shirts, t-shirts, shoes, hygiene products), seller verification through NID and certificate uploads, product approval workflows, shopping cart and wishlist functionality, order tracking, return/refund management, real-time chat messaging between buyers and sellers, and a secure payout system for sellers.

The application will be developed as a responsive web application using PHP, MySQL, and modern frontend technologies, ensuring accessibility across desktop and mobile devices. This marketplace creates value for all stakeholders while promoting sustainable consumption practices in the fashion industry.
